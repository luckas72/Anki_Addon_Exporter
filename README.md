</p>
A mini application for those people who are lazy to get their Anki's addon code manually. 

## Problem

If you have ever experienced an error in Anki and the only solution is reinstallation, then all your beloved addons would most likely disappear. It is painful to go through the addon page to get those addon codes. Even worse when you have to rely on your memory which addon you used previously.
***
## Solution
An application that would extract all your addon's code (numbers), so you could have them added once you have Anki reinstalled. 

## Objective 
Save lazy people's time

***
## Screenshot

### Using default (Only for Anki2.1.x):

#### Window executable
Clone my `windowExe/dist/ankiExport.exe` and open it.

#### Mac .app runnable
Clone my `/macApp/dist/ankiExport.app` (the whole `ankiExport.app` thing), and change to the directory where you cloned the file by using terminal and then use the command 
```
open ankiExport.app
```
to run it.
