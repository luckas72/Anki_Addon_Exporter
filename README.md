# Anki_Addon_Exporter
A mini application for those people who are lazy to get their Anki's addon code manually. ]


## Problem

If you have ever experienced an error in Anki and the only solution is reinstallation, then all your beloved addons would most likely disappear. It is painful to go through the addon page to get those addon codes. Even worse when you have to rely on your memory which addon you used previously.
***
## Solution
An application that would extract all your addon's code (numbers), so you could have them added once you have Anki reinstalled. 

## Objective 
Save lazy people's time
